# <u>Will John Doe survive the titanic?</u>

In 1912, the titanic had an accident and many people died. A common challenge in the kaggle community is to determine wether a given person would survive. Each person is determined by following details:

- PassengerId
- Passenger Class
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses on Titanic
- Number of parents/children on Titanic
- Ticket Number
- Fare (Price paid)
- Cabin Number
- Embarkation Port

My goal in this project is to find similarities between the survivors/deads to be able to extract "pattern" to give an "opinion" wether or not that person would have survived the titanic accident.

The project is done with python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) and a jupyter notebook. Later on, I will try to train a machine learning model with tensorflow to compare it with my "self-made" analysis.
